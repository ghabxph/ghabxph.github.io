## Teacher's Perspective

This one is intended to act  as  lesson  plan  for  teachers  who  introduces  programming  to their
students. I am a teacher,  and I use this personal blog of mine to write my lesson plans and publish
them here in  my blog.  For students who do self-study, this lesson might be very boring  to read on
your own. I understand it, because I meant this content for me to  present  to  students.  Adding an
element of talking in front of students is one important element to  make  this  lecture  digestable
for students.

## You will Learn

In this page, you will learn:

- The features, creator, and history of **Python**
- **Python's** design philosophy
- The use of **Python** in the **Real World**


## Introduction

Our goal in this lesson is to teach someone with **zero** technical  skills to learn the very basics
of Computer Programming. To make the lesson very easy to digest,  I  have  chosen **Python**  as our
main programming language.

Python is  a very straight-forward  programming language that is very perfect for beginners.  I made
this course for my children, so the target audience is someone around Grade 7 with basic literacy on
how to read.

### What is Python

**Python** - Python  is  an  **interpreted**,  **high-level**  and  **general-purpose**  programming
language,  created  by  **Guido  Van  Rossum**  and  is  first released in **1991**. Python's design
philosophy emphasizes **code readability**, with its notable use of  **significant whitespace**. Its
language constructs and  object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,  logical code
for small and large-scale projects.

### Python's Use Case

Python is well-known used for:
- Web Development
  - **Web Development Frameworks**
    - Django
    - Pyramid
  - **Web Development Micro-Frameworks**
    - Flask
    - Bottle
  - **Advanced CMSs (Content Management Systems)**
    - Plone
    - Django CMS
  - **Python's Standard Libraries**
    - HTML and XML
    - JSON
    - E-mail processing
    - FTP, IMAP, and other Internet Protocols
    - Easy to use socket interface
  - **User-developed libraries**
    - Requests
    - Beautiful Soup
    - Feedparser
    - Paramiko
    
- Scientific and Numeric Computing
  - Python is widely used in **scientific and numeric** computing:
    - **SciPy** is a colection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.
    - **Pandas** is a data analysis and modeling library
    - **IPython** is a powerful interactive shell that features easy editing and recording of a work
      session and supports visualizations and parallel computing.
    - The **Software Carpentry Course** teaches  basic  skills  for  scientific  computing,  running
      bootcamps and providing open-access teaching materials.
- Education
  - **This is what we are doing right now.** I  am  using  python  to  introduce  you  to **Computer
    Programming**
  - Python is a superb-language for teaching programming, both at the  introductory level  and  more
    advanced courses.
    - There are books written  such  as  **How  to  Think  Like  a  Computer  Scientist**,  **Python
      Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science**, and **Practical Programming***
- Desktop GUIs
  - The **Tk** GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python
  - Some toolkits that are usable on several platforms are available separately:
    - wxWidgets
    - Kivy, for writing multitouch applications
    - Qt via pyqt or pyside
  - Platform-specific toolkits are also available:
    - GTK+ -- Cross Platform GUI Development
    - Microsoft Foundation Classes through the  win32  extensions --  GUI  Development  for  Windows
- Software Development
  - Python  is  often  used  as  a **support  language**  for **software  developers**,  for **build
    control and management**, **testing**, and in many other ways.
    - **SCons** for build control
    - **Buildbot** and **Apache Gump** for automated continuous compilation and testing
    - **Roundup** or **Trac** for bug tracking and project management
- Business Applications
  - Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:
    - **Odoo** is an all-in-one management software that offers a range of business applications
      that form a complete suite of enterprise management applications.
    - **Tryton** is a three-tier high-level general purpose application platform.
    
**Personal opinion:** Python is an all-around programming  language.  Imagination  is  actually  the
limit. You can almost do anything with Python.


#### **We will not learn those.**

In this course, you will just learn the very ultra basics. I assume that you have **zero** technical
experience, but I aim in this course to learn people with zero technical skills.

The goal of this lesson is to introduce you to the world of programming.  I  chose  python  as  your
introductory programming language, because python is straight forward and is  very  easy  to  learn.


## Computer Programming
Computer programming is the process of designing and building  an  executable  computer  program  to
accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific  task.  Programming  involves  tasks
such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and  resource  consumption,
and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen  programming  language  (commonly  referred  to  as
coding).

The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to
programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.
The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance
of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given
problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects,
including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

## Algorithm
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a finite
sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems
or to perform a computation.[1][2] Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications
for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
