> [On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog) - [Peter Steiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Steiner_(cartoonist)**

How do you identify yourself in the internet? Through username and password, and it is still true
at this very present time.

Imagine a world where you no longer need to keep passwords. You can still keep yourself anonymous
and create a digital identity online, but the attribute of you being you is still there?

In the world where the self sovereign identity is adopted, passwords are no longer necessary. In
case that you lost your mobile phone where your source of identity is kept, issuers can revoke
your ID and you can reclaim your identity in your new wallet and never start over again.

**PS: Writing in progress, I am still gathering some nice thoughts. Of course, this will still be
revised, and I'll do some proofreads before officially posting it**
