How do you identify yourself in the internet? Through username and password, and it is still true
at this very present time.

Imagine a world where you no longer need to keep passwords. You can still keep yourself anonymous
and create a digital identity online, but the attribute of you being you is still there?

**PS: Writing in progress, I am still gathering some nice thoughts. Of course, this will still be
revised, and I'll do some proofreads before officially posting it**
