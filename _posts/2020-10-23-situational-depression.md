Honestly, I am broken inside. It is not very easy to write something like this on a blog.  I also do
not post anything on social media that I am depressed. On social media,  I just like to share little
stupid  things  like games,  rants, memes,  anime,  or anything light.  The character  that I’d like
everyone to see is me being a smartass, carefree individual,  devoid of any emotional shits in life,
and I think it’s the right thing to do.

I am aiding myself through medication (prescribed drug) that is a type of mood stabilizer to help me
to stabilize my mood.  But there are just some situations that really put me down to the gutter  and
it’s just so hard to move around and to recover.

For anyone who’s experiencing depression,  keep fighting. You guys can do it.  We can do it.  We all
have different circumstances in life. We  should keep  ourselves in check.  It is highly recommended
to seek professional support and take proper medication to help us out.

Why did I write this?  Because you are not alone.  And I’d like  to use this medium to reach you out
and tell you that we can do it.
