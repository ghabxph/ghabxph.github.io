Welcome to the the old and classic, and overused: Cosmological Argument.
 - Insert St. Thomas Aquinas's Cosmological Argument.
 - Insert Kalam Cosmological Argument
 - What else?

First things first, to be fair, I will not say that "god does not exist",  but I stand on atheism. I
do not believe  in god and I do  not  think  that there is god, but I will not  say that it does not
exist, so  just to be  fair and avoid  the fallacy of  "argument from  ignorance", in  which you may
against me. So my answer is I do not know.

So if you will come to me and ask: "Gab, is there a god?" I will respond to you: "I do not know, but
I do not believe in god and to me, there is no god". Simple as that.

In  the  scientific community, the accepted  explanation to the  birth of universe,  is the Big Bang
Theory. This entire existence  begans from a singularity  that consist all matter and  energy of the
universe, until it explodes and grows until it reaches something what we know "universe".

But  there is problem within  scientific community up to this date:  "We do not know what causes, or
what is before the Big Bang".

Some says, it has to be god. Because:
1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
2. The Universe began to exist.
3. Therefore, the Universe has a cause. --> god.

AHA --> The old and classic: The Cosmological Argument, that can be dated back to St. Thomas Aquinas
that is repeatedly overused by our fellow intelligent debaters in the side of theistic worldview, to
validate existence of god,  or to some shady individuals  that  misrepresent science that  an entity
such as god has to cause the Big Bang.

May sound strong to you: But no. I will refute this.
1. It commits the fallacy of argument from ignorance.
2. It exploits  deductive  reasoning incorrectly --> that  harms the healthy view of how you  should
   actually see the world.
3. "I do not know" is a valid answer, better than saying "god did it."

Point #1: Argument from Ignorance.
It does not mean that "we do not know" before Big Bang,  would mean that  "god must've caused it". I
always hear this argument from time to time, so I am here to educate you. The right answer is "we do
not  know".  If you  will  say that "god did it",  then you  have to provide  sufficient evidence to
support your claim. -- Argumentation theory --> Burden of proof.

Cosmological argument violates argument from ignorance. Therefore invalid.

Point #2: It exploits deductive reasoning incorrectly.
Number one: To describe the universe through  deductive reasoning will never work. Scientific method
works by inductive reasoning.
Number two: The important element of deductive reasoning is  valid presentation of facts. You should
hold facts.  

Statement #1: Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
 --> Nope. That is not always the case. Through science, this has proven to be wrong. Welcome to the
world of Quantum Mechanics.
 --> Statement #1 is not a fact.

Reconstructing the statements:
1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause --> is not always the case. --> Not fact.
2. The Universe began to exist. --> Big Bang.
3. Therefore, the Universe has a cause. --> not always the case. Invalid.

Cosmological argument's first statement is invalid, therefore conclusion is invalid as well.

Point #3: "I do not know" is a valid answer, better than saying "god did it."
Before, our concept of weather, is that it is something  that is caused by "gods".,  and you pray to
some  god  to rain,  or to end storm,  and so on.  But today, by learning different types of clouds,
learning  to  measure  atmospheric  presure (barometer), humidity  (hygrometer),  helped  us predict
weather, that allows us to prepare ahead of time.

In the past, our theory of disease is that:
- It is punishment made by god.
- It is caused by the devil.
- Caused by witchcraft.

That the thing we call bubonic plague today,  is known in the past that is caused by miasma,  or any
other statement that stems from our lack of understanding.

But learning further the microscopic element of life, we learn that there are microorganisms such as
bacteria, amoeba,  fungi,  so on,  that  can  cause disease to us,  and  this knowledge helped us to
understand  the  importance  of  proper hygiene,  and  further prevention of  disease  through right
awareness.

Now, we have mystery. The story "Before Big Bang".

I do not know it,  therefore it must be god. Today, it is not the case. It should never be the case.
It is always better to say that you do not know something,  and dig deeper to know what is it really
to further  understand something. Follow scientific  method. Become literate to science. Earn enough
competence to dispute and  test established facts to further validate  things about the mysteries of
the world, is the way to go than to say that  "god is the answer". --> Simply, enlightenment through
continous education.

From time to time,  "god" is getting out of the picture, as we understand deeply about the universe.
Through education, we slowly move to a secularist worldview, than a religious world view. --> And to
my belief, world is never created by a god, nor there was such an entity. --> *Note:* To my belief.

My final thought:
To me,  assuming that universe is caused by a "god", is an insult to human progress,  and it is just
an argument I cannot tolerate, to me personally at least.  It is better to say that you  do not know
it, than saying that it is god.

To me,  the Cosmological Argument is very arrogant. This very modern world, through time and current
man's progress,  proves  this to be invalid.  Simply,  an  outdated worldview  that  does not fit to
reality as we know.

To properly understand the universe,  requires learning through proper education.  Education is your
key  to enlightenment,  and not  some deceptive texts  and people that distorts your  view about the
world.

I rest my case. Thank you for reading.
