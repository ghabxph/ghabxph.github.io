### **tl;dr**
1. Reach me out through my email
2. Never ever attempt to add me on FB
2. For job opportunities, reach me out via LinkedIn, or email.


### **Story of my life**
Everyone can  reach me out  through  this email [{{site.email}}][site-email].  I do not  respond  to
spam or simply annoying emails,  and they’re  automatically  thrown to spam  and blocked forever.  I
indicated my official social media account on  this page, simply because they’re  just open for dox.
Dox me all you want for like I care.  Anyone could find my  social media,  so it is something that I
expect that you can already figure out. Same with my Github account. Well,  GitHub is something that
I’d like you to see after all.

About Facebook, I do not respond to friend requests, so do not ever attempt to add me because I will
simply ignore it. I only add desired individuals within my circle. For FB, there’s nothing very much
interesting about it. It’s full of pure personal stuff that you might not be interested to see.

For  job opportunities,  you may reach out via my  LinkedIn account via PM,  or send me an email and
let’s discuss things there.  I am always open to job opportunities that will expand my knowledge and
skills.
