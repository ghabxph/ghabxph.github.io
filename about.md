This is **Gabriel's** personal  blog  which may  contain  his  personal  world views,  beliefs,  and
interest about technology.  You will expect more of  his opinions about his  particular of  interest
that may be about religion, politics, or technology.  His  opinion may  not actually  reflect  facts
or reality about the world.  After all,  we are living in a  free  country  where freedom of  speech
is a basic human right, or are we?

**Gabriel** wishes to maintain a set of categories so that readers would not  be  confused  on  what
to read. For now, he is just starting this hobby of writing so there's nothing to categorize at this
moment.

This blog is powered by  [Jekyll][jekyll-org]  and is hosted on  Github Pages for free.  He likes to
operate his things through git,  thus this  setup suits to his likings.  It all begins on creating a
markdown page, and then commit and push to github.
